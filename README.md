C++ console tictactoe with 2 player and vs COMP
This is a tictactoe game I made in C++ for the console. The board is made with a character array that contains a number character(1-9) in each index.
The menu driven interface allows the player to choose the box or options.
There is a 2 player option and v.s. Computer option that lets you choose whether you want to be player 1 or player 2. The computer uses 2 functions to decide if it can win in the next turn,should it block, or get closer to winning. 
The can I win next turn function and block function uses the current character array's contents to evaluate options.
Thank you for viewing!
